<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 1</span> Basics: An example workflow</h1>
<p>A <em>Snakemake</em> workflow is defined by specifying rules in a Snakefile.
Rules decompose the workflow into small steps (for example, the application of a single tool) by specifying how to create sets of output files from sets of input files.
<em>Snakemake</em> automatically determines the dependencies between the rules by matching file names.</p>
<p>The <em>Snakemake</em> language extends the <em>Python</em> language, adding syntactic structures for rule definition and additional controls.
All added syntactic structures begin with a keyword followed by a code block that is either in the same line or indented and consisting of multiple lines.
The resulting syntax resembles that of original <em>Python</em> constructs.</p>
<p>In the following, we will introduce the <em>Snakemake</em> syntax by creating an example workflow.
The workflow comes from the domain of genome analysis.
It maps sequencing reads to a reference genome and calls variants on the mapped reads.
The tutorial does not require you to know what this is about.
Nevertheless, we provide some background in the following paragraph.</p>
<div id="background" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The genome of a living organism encodes its hereditary information.
It serves as a blueprint for proteins, which form living cells, carry information and drive chemical reactions.
Differences between species, populations or individuals can be reflected by differences in the genome.
Certain variants can cause syndromes or predisposition for certain diseases, or cause cancerous growth in the case of tumour cells that have accumulated changes with respect to healthy cells.
This makes the genome a major target of biological and medical research.
Today, it is often analyzed with DNA sequencing, producing gigabytes of data from a single biological sample (for example a biopsy of some tissue).
For technical reasons, DNA sequencing cuts the DNA of a sample into millions of small pieces, called reads.
In order to recover the genome of the sample, one has to map these reads against a known reference genome (for example, the human one obtained during the famous human genome project).
This task is called read mapping.
Often, it is of interest where an individual genome is different from the species-wide consensus represented with the reference genome.
Such differences are called variants.
They are responsible for harmless individual differences (like eye color), but can also cause diseases like cancer.
By investigating the differences between the mapped reads and the reference sequence at a particular genome position, variants can be detected.
This is a statistical challenge, because they have to be distinguished from artifacts generated by the sequencing process.</p>
</div>
<div id="mapping-reads" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Mapping reads</h2>
<p>Our first <em>Snakemake</em> rule maps reads of a given sample to a given reference genome.
For this, we will use the tool bwa, specifically the subcommand bwa mem.
In the working directory, create a new file called Snakefile using R-studio.
In the Snakefile, define the following rule</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> A common error is to forget the comma between the input or output items. Since <em>Python</em> concatenates subsequent strings, this can lead to unexpected behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <em>Snakemake</em> rule has a name (here <code>bwa_mem</code>) and a number of directives, here <code>input</code>, <code>output</code>, <code>singularity</code> and <code>shell</code>.
The <code>input</code> and <code>output</code> directives are followed by lists of files that are expected to be used or created by the rule.
In the simplest case, these are just explicit Python <em>strings</em>.
The <code>singularity</code> directive is followed by a <em>Python</em> string containing the address of the container with <code>bwa</code>.
The <code>shell</code> directive is followed by a <em>Python</em> string containing the shell command to execute.
In the <code>shell</code> command string, we can refer to elements of the rule via braces notation (similar to the <em>Python</em> format function).
Here, we refer to the output file by specifying <code>{output}</code> and to the input files by specifying <code>{input}</code>.
Since the rule has multiple input files, <em>Snakemake</em> will concatenate them, separated by a whitespace.
In other words, <em>Snakemake</em> will replace <code>{input}</code> with <code>data/genome.fa data/samples/A.fastq</code> before executing the command.
The shell command invokes <code>bwa mem</code> with reference genome and reads. The output of <code>bwa mem</code> is redirected into the output file defined by the rule with <code>&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>When a workflow is executed, <em>Snakemake</em> tries to generate given target files.
Target files can be specified via the command line. By executing</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> It is best practice to have subsequent steps of a workflow in separate, unique, output folders. This keeps the working directory structured. Further, such unique prefixes allow Snakemake to quickly discard most rules in its search for rules that can provide the requested input. This accelerates the resolution of the rule dependencies in a workflow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>in the working directory containing the Snakefile, we tell <em>Snakemake</em> to generate the target file <code>results/mapped_reads/A.sam</code>.
Since we used the <code>-n</code> (or <code>--dry-run</code>) flag, <em>Snakemake</em> will only show the execution plan instead of actually performing the steps.
The <code>-p</code> flag instructs <em>Snakemake</em> to also print the resulting shell command for illustration.
To generate the target files, <em>Snakemake</em> applies the rules given in the Snakefile in a top-down way.
The application of a rule to generate a set of output files is called job.
For each input file of a job, <em>Snakemake</em> again (i.e. recursively) determines rules that can be applied to generate it.
This yields a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of jobs where the edges represent dependencies.
So far, we only have a single rule, and the DAG of jobs consists of a single node.
Nevertheless, we can execute our workflow with</p>
<p>Whenever executing a workflow, you need to specify the number of cores to use.
For this tutorial, we will use a single core for now.
Later you will see how parallelization works.
Note that, after completion of above command, <em>Snakemake</em> will not try to create <code>results/mapped_reads/A.sam</code> again, because it is already present in the file system.
<em>Snakemake</em> only re-runs jobs if one of the input files is newer than one of the output files or one of the input files will be updated by another job.</p>
</div>
<div id="generalizing-the-read-mapping-rule" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Generalizing the read mapping rule</h2>
<p>Obviously, the rule will only work for a single sample with reads in the file <code>data/samples/A.fastq</code>.
However, <em>Snakemake</em> allows generalizing rules by using named wildcards.
Simply replace the A in the second input file and in the output file with the wildcard <code>{sample}</code>, leading to</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> Note that if a rule has multiple output files, <em>Snakemake</em> requires them to all have exactly the same wildcards. Otherwise, it could happen that two jobs running the same rule in parallel want to write to the same file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When <em>Snakemake</em> determines that this rule can be applied to generate a target file by replacing the wildcard <code>{sample}</code> in the output file with an appropriate value, it will propagate that value to all occurrences of <code>{sample}</code> in the input files and thereby determine the necessary input for the resulting job.
Note that you can have multiple wildcards in your file paths, however, to avoid conflicts with other jobs of the same rule, all output files of a rule have to contain exactly the same wildcards.</p>
<p>When executing</p>
<p>Snakemake will determine that the rule <code>bwa_mem</code> can be applied to generate the target file by replacing the wildcard <code>{sample}</code> with the value B.
In the output of the dry-run, you will see how the wildcard value is propagated to the input files and all filenames in the shell command.
You can also specify multiple targets, for example:</p>
<p>Some <em>Bash</em> magic can make this particularly handy.
For example, you can alternatively compose our multiple targets in a single pass via</p>
<p>Note that this is not a special <em>Snakemake</em> syntax.
<em>Bash</em> is just applying its brace expansion to the set <code>{A,B}</code>, creating the given path for each element and separating the resulting paths by a whitespace.</p>
<p>In both cases, you will see that <em>Snakemake</em> only proposes to create the output file <code>results/mapped_reads/B.sam</code>.
This is because you already executed the workflow before (see the previous step) and no input file is newer than the output file <code>results/mapped_reads/A.sam</code>.
You can update the file modification date of the input file <code>data/samples/A.fastq</code> via</p>
<p>and see how <em>Snakemake</em> wants to re-run the job to create the file <code>results/mapped_reads/A.sam</code> by executing</p>
</div>
<div id="compressing-and-sorting-read-alignments" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Compressing and sorting read alignments</h2>
<p>For later steps, we need the read alignments in the BAM files to be sorted. This can be achieved with the samtools sort command. We add the following rule beneath the bwa_map rule:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> In the shell command above we split the string into two lines, which are however automatically concatenated into one by Python. This is a handy pattern to avoid too long shell command lines. When using this, make sure to have a trailing whitespace in each line but the last, in order to avoid arguments to become not properly separated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This rule will take the input file from the <code>mapped_reads</code> directory and store a sorted version in the <code>sorted_reads directory</code> after compression into BAM.
Note that <em>Snakemake</em> automatically creates missing directories before jobs are executed.
The shell command invokes <code>samtools view</code> with the SAM file which creates a compressed BAM file containing the alignments, and pipes the output into <code>samtools sort</code>.
The output of <code>samtools</code> is redirected into the output file defined by the rule with <code>&gt;</code>.
For sorting, <code>samtools</code> requires a prefix specified with the flag <code>-T</code>.
Here, we need the value of the wildcard <code>sample</code>.
<em>Snakemake</em> allows to access wildcards in the shell command via the <code>wildcards</code> object that has an attribute with the value for each wildcard.</p>
<p>When issuing</p>
<p>you will see how <em>Snakemake</em> wants to run first the rule <code>bwa_mem</code> and then the rule <code>samtools_sort</code> to create the desired target file:
as mentioned before, the dependencies are resolved automatically by matching file names.</p>
</div>
<div id="indexing-read-alignments-and-visualizing-the-dag-of-jobs" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Indexing read alignments and visualizing the DAG of jobs</h2>
<p>Next, we need to use samtools again to index the sorted read alignments so that we can quickly access reads by the genomic location they were mapped to.
This can be done with the following rule:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> <em>Snakemake</em> uses the <em>Python</em> format mini language to format shell commands. Sometimes you have to use braces (<code>{}</code>) for something else in a shell command. In that case, you have to escape them by doubling, for example when relying on the bash brace expansion we mentioned above: <code>ls {{A,B}}.txt</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having three steps already, it is a good time to take a closer look at the resulting directed acyclic graph (DAG) of jobs. By executing</p>
<p>we create a visualization of the DAG using the <code>dot</code> command provided by Graphviz.
For the given target files, <em>Snakemake</em> specifies the DAG in the dot language and pipes it into the <code>dot</code> command, which renders the definition into SVG format.
The rendered DAG is piped into the file <code>dag.svg</code> and will look similar to this:</p>
<p>The DAG contains a node for each job with the edges connecting them representing the dependencies.
The frames of jobs that don’t need to be run (because their output is up-to-date) are dashed.
For rules with wildcards, the value of the wildcard for the particular job is displayed in the job node.</p>
<div id="exercise" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>Run parts of the workflow using different targets. Recreate the DAG and see how different rules’ frames become dashed because their output is present and up-to-date.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="calling-genomic-variants" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Calling genomic variants</h2>
<p>The next step in our workflow will aggregate the mapped reads from all samples and jointly call genomic variants on them.
For the variant calling, we will combine the two utilities <code>samtools</code> and <code>bcftools</code>.
<em>Snakemake</em> provides a helper function for collecting input files that helps us to describe the aggregation in this step. With</p>
<p>we obtain a list of files where the given pattern <code>"sorted_reads/{sample}.bam"</code> was formatted with the values in a given list of samples <code>SAMPLES</code>, i.e.</p>
<p>The function is particularly useful when the pattern contains multiple wildcards. For example,</p>
<p>would create the product of all elements of <code>SAMPLES</code> and the list <code>[0, 1]</code>, yielding</p>
<p>Here, we use only the simple case of <code>expand</code>.
We first let <em>Snakemake</em> know which samples we want to consider.
Remember that <em>Snakemake</em> works backwards from requested output, and not from available input.
Thus, it does not automatically infer all possible output from, for example, the fastq files in the data folder.
Also remember that <em>Snakefiles</em> are in principle <em>Python</em> code enhanced by some declarative statements to define workflows.
Hence, we can define the list of samples ad-hoc in plain Python at the top of the Snakefile:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> If you name input or output files like above, their order won’t be preserved when referring to them as <code>{input}</code>. Further, note that named and unnamed (i.e., positional) input and output files can be combined, but the positional ones must come first, equivalent to <em>Python</em> functions with keyword arguments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later, we will learn about more sophisticated ways like config files.
But for now, this is enough so that we can add the following rules to our Snakefile:</p>
<p>With multiple input or output files, it is sometimes handy to refer to them separately in the shell command.
This can be done by specifying names for input or output files, for example with <code>fa=...</code>.
The files can then be referred to in the shell command by name, for example with <code>{input.fa}</code>.
Further, you will notice that the input or output file lists can contain arbitrary <em>Python</em> statements, as long as it returns a string, or a list of strings. Here, we invoke our expand function to aggregate over the aligned reads of all samples.</p>
<div id="exercise-1" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>Obtain the updated DAG of jobs for the target file <code>results/calls/all.vcf</code>, it should look like this:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="using-custom-scripts" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.6</span> Using custom scripts</h2>
<p>Usually, a workflow not only consists of invoking various tools, but also contains custom code to for example calculate summary statistics or create plots.
While <em>Snakemake</em> also allows you to directly write Python code inside a rule, it is usually reasonable to move such logic into separate scripts.
For this purpose, <em>Snakemake</em> offers the script directive.
Add the following rule to your Snakefile:</p>
<p>With this rule, we will eventually generate a histogram of the quality scores that have been assigned to the variant calls in the file <code>results/calls/all.vcf</code>.
The actual Python code to generate the plot is hidden in the script <code>scripts/plot-quals.R</code>.
Script paths are always relative to the referring Snakefile.
In the script, all properties of the rule like <code>input</code>, <code>output</code>, <code>wildcards</code>, etc. are available as attributes of a global <code>snakemake</code> object.
Create the file <code>scripts/plot-quals.R</code>, with the following content:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> <code>snakemake.input</code> and <code>snakemake.output</code> always contain a list of file names, even if the lists each contain only one file name. Therefore, to refer to a particular file name, you have to index into that list. <code>snakemake.output[0]</code> in <em>Python</em> or <code>snakemake@output[[1]]</code> in <em>R</em> will give you the first element of the output file name list, something that always has to be there.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> It is best practice to use the script directive whenever an inline code block would have more than a few lines of code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although there are other strategies to invoke separate scripts from your workflow (for example, invoking them via shell commands), the benefit of this is obvious:
the script logic is separated from the workflow logic (and can even be shared between workflows), but boilerplate code like the parsing of command line arguments is unnecessary.</p>

<div id="adding-a-target-rule" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.7</span> Adding a target rule</h2>
<p>So far, we always executed the workflow by specifying a target file at the command line.
Apart from filenames, <em>Snakemake</em> also accepts rule names as targets if the requested rule does not have wildcards.
Hence, it is possible to write target rules collecting particular subsets of the desired results or all results.
Moreover, if no target is given at the command line, <em>Snakemake</em> will define the first rule of the Snakefile as the target.
Hence, it is best practice to have a rule all at the top of the workflow which has all typically desired target files as input files.</p>
<p>Here, this means that we add a rule</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> In case you have mutliple reasonable sets of target files, you can add multiple target rules at the top of the Snakefile. While Snakemake will execute the first per default, you can target any of them via the command line (for example, <code>snakemake -n mytarget</code>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the execution plan for creating the file <code>results/plots/quals.png</code>, which contains and summarizes all our results, will be shown.
Note that, apart from <em>Snakemake</em> considering the first rule of the workflow as the default target, the order of rules in the Snakefile is arbitrary and does not influence the DAG of jobs.</p>
<div id="exercise-2" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>Create the DAG of jobs for the complete workflow.</p>
<p>Execute the complete workflow and have a look at the <code>results/plots/quals.svg</code>.</p>
<p><em>Snakemake</em> provides handy flags for forcing re-execution of parts of the workflow.
Have a look at the command line help with <code>snakemake --help</code> and search for the flag <code>--forcerun</code>.
Then, use this flag to re-execute the rule <code>samtools_sort</code> and see what happens.</p>
<p>With <code>--reason</code> it is possible to display the execution reason for each job.
Try this flag together with a dry-run and the <code>--forcerun</code> flag to understand the decisions of <em>Snakemake</em>.</p>
